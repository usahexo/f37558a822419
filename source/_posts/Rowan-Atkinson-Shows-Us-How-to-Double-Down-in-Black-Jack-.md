# Rowan Atkinson Shows Us How to Double Down in Black Jack 

If you're looking for a sure way to win at blackjack, heed the advice of Rowan Atkinson – double down on 11.

Not only is this a sound strategy, but it's also really fun to say. "Double down on 11!"

The rule of thumb is that if your first two cards are a certain point value, you can elect to double your bet and receive just one additional card. For instance, if you have a six and an eight as your initial two cards (6 + 8 = 14), you would "double down" because the point total is within the double down zone.

In blackjack, there are generally three different outcomes when you hit: Bust (going over 21), Stand (staying with what you've got), or Hit (taking another card). Doubling down means that even if you hit and go over 21, you still only lose your original bet – not the doubled amount.

So why should you double down on 11? The reason is simple: the chances of going bust are relatively low, while the potential payout is high. With an ace and a Jack (11), for instance, the dealer has a likely bust hand (17 or higher). That means that if you double down on 11 and hit again, there's a good chance you'll win! And since blackjack usually pays out 3:2 on winning bets, that means you'll walk away with more cash in your pocket than if you had simply stood pat.

One final note: always make sure that the casino allows doubling down before trying this strategy!

# Learn from the Best: Rowan Atkinson's Guide to Doubling Down in Black Jack

How do you approach black jack when the odds are against you? Comedian Rowan Atkinson, who has played the game since his teenage years, has some tips.

First, if you have a choice between hitting and standing, always hit if the dealer is showing a card worth 10 or less (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and always stand if the dealer is showing a card worth 11 or more (e.g. 7, 8, 9, 10, ace). This gives you the best chance to win.

When you do hit,double down if your first two cards add up to nine or 11. For example, if you have an Ace and a 2 as your first two cards (A+2), double down . If you have any other combination of cards (e.g. 5 and 4), don't bother doubling down - just hit instead.

If the dealer's upcard is anything other than a 2-6 , split your pairs (e.g. 2 identical cards like two kings). For instance, if the dealer shows an Ace , split your Aces and bet on each one individually . This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself more opportunities to beat the dealer's hand.

Finally, never take insurance - it's just a waste of money.
