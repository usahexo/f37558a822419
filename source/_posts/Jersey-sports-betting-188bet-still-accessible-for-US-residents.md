#  NJ gambling sites: How to work around the jersey sports betting 188bet ban

New Jersey, after putting in a great deal of effort, finally got the okay to offer legalized sports betting within its borders in June of 2018. This was a huge victory for the state and its residents, who have been eagerly awaiting this opportunity for years. The first casinos to offer sports betting were Monmouth Park Racetrack and the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, both located in Atlantic City.

However, there was one small catch – NJ gambling sites were not allowed to accept bets from people located in other states. This was due to a 1992 federal law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which barred all but four states (Oregon, Delaware, Montana, and Nevada) from legalizing sports betting.

Now that PASPA has been overturned by the US Supreme Court, New Jersey is busy reworking its sports betting regulations to allow out-of-state bettors to place bets with NJ gambling sites. But in the meantime, there are a few ways that NJ residents can still place bets on their favorite teams.

One way is to use an offshore site that accepts New Jersey customers. These sites are not regulated by the state government, but they do comply with federal laws and are licensed and regulated by respected gaming authorities such as the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner or the Kahnawake Gaming Commission.

Another option is to use a New Jersey-licensed online casino or poker site that offers sports betting. These sites are regulated by the state government, so you can be sure that your money is safe and that the games are fair. In addition, these sites offer bonuses and other promotions that can be valuable for New Jersey residents.

Finally, you can also bet on sports through an illegal offshore site. However, we do not recommend doing this because there is no guarantee that these sites are safe or fair. In addition, you could get into legal trouble if you are caught betting with an unauthorized site.
