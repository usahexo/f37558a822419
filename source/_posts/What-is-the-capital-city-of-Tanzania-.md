#  What is the capital city of Tanzania? 

Dodoma is the capital city of Tanzania and it's located in the center of the country. The city has a population of around 423,000 and it's the home to the national parliament and other government offices.

#  What is the population of Tanzania? 

The population of Tanzania, as of 2019, is estimated to be around 58.5 million people. This number is constantly changing, however, and so the most up-to-date estimate may be different from the one given here. 

Tanzania is home to a variety of cultures and languages, with over 120 indigenous dialects spoken across the country. The largest ethnic group is the Swahili, who make up about 85% of the population. Other major groups include the Ikizu (9%), the Haya (7%), and the Nyamwezi (6%). 

Tanzania's population is still growing rapidly, with an annual growth rate of around 2.8%. This means that the population is increasing by more than 2 million people every year! As a result, pressure is increasing on resources like food and water, and it will become increasingly important to ensure that everyone has access to these essentials. 

Fortunately, Tanzania is making progress in this area. The percentage of people who are living in poverty has decreased significantly in recent years, and life expectancy is also on the rise. With continued dedication to ensuring that all Tanzanians have access to basic needs like education and health care, the population of Tanzania can continue to thrive.

#  What is the currency of Tanzania? 

The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzanian shilling.

#  What languages are spoken in Tanzania? 

The country of Tanzania lies in eastern Africa and is home to over 120 different languages. While English is the official language of the country, Swahili is also widely spoken. Other notable languages include Arabic, Luganda, and Haya.

#  What is the primary religion in Tanzania?

Islam is the primary religion in Tanzania. Approximately 50% of the population identifies as Muslim, while 30% identify as Christian. The remaining population is composed of various indigenous religions and minority faiths.

Islam arrived in Tanzania during the early period of Arab exploration and conquest of the African continent. Muslim traders and travelers traversed the East African coast, bringing Islam to the region. Over time, it spread inland and gained a following among the local populations.

Christianity arrived in Tanzania in the late 19th century, brought by European missionaries. The missionaries were followed by colonialists, who sought to establish control over the region. Through various means, Christianity became prevalent among the settler community and eventually wider segments of Tanzanian society.

The indigenous religions of Tanzania are a diverse assortment of beliefs and practices that predate both Islam and Christianity on the continent. Many of these religions are animist, based on a belief that natural objects and phenomena have spirits that can be interacted with for spiritual benefit. Other indigenous religious traditions include Hinduism and Buddhism, which were introduced to East Africa through Indian traders and immigrants.
