#  Italian Online Casino Reports Record Revenue

The Italian online casino industry saw record revenue in 2017, with total earnings hitting €1.5 billion, according to a recent report from the country’s gaming authority, AAMS. This represented a 21% increase over the previous year’s total, and signals that the Italian market is continuing to grow in popularity despite tightening regulations.

Much of the growth is being driven by mobile gaming, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of all online casino revenue in 2017. This is largely thanks to the increasing number of Italians using smartphones and other mobile devices to access gambling content. In fact, according to a survey conducted by AAMS, over half of all online casino gamers in Italy are now using mobile devices.

This trend is also being seen in other countries around the world, with mobile gaming now accounting for more than half of all online casino revenue in several major markets. This presents a major opportunity for operators looking to expand into new markets, as well as for those looking to increase their market share in existing ones.

It should be noted that the growth in online casino revenue does not necessarily reflect an increase in overall gambling activity among Italians. In fact, overall gambling spending has been relatively flat in recent years, with most of the growth coming from expanded offerings and rising consumer demand for new experiences.

This suggests that many Italian gamblers are choosing to gamble online rather than at traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. This may be due to a combination of factors such as convenience, accessibility, and variety of games offered. It’s also worth noting that online casinos often offer generous sign-up bonuses and other promotions that can sweeten the pot for players.

Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that the Italian online casino market is booming and is likely to continue doing so for years to come. Operators who want to tap into this lucrative market would do well to consider expanding their operations into Italy or partnering with an existing operator here.
