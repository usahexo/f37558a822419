            <h1 id="Pelicans-score-big-with-large-blackjack-crowds"><a href="#Pelicans-score-big-with-large-blackjack-crowds" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans score big with large blackjack crowds"></a>Pelicans score big with large blackjack crowds</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Large blackjack crowds have been stimulating the New Orleans Pelicans NBA team both on and off the court. In their last game, they blew out the Houston Rockets with a final score of 119 to 86. This impressive victory was due in part to the large number of enthusiastic fans in attendance.</p>
<p>The Pelicans organization is thrilled with the response they’ve been getting from the New Orleans community. Many people are excited to see such an energetic and talented team in action. And let’s not forget about those famous Louisiana hospitality vibes!</p>
<p>The players are definitely feeling the love, too. As Jrue Holiday put it, “It felt good to have that [crowd] behind us. We just wanted to come out and play with that energy, and I think we did that.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not the first time that a strong blackjack turnout has benefited the Pelicans. Back in February, they also crushed the Phoenix Suns with a final score of 116 to 104. Coincidence? We think not!</p>
<p>It seems clear that when blackjack enthusiasts unite, great things can happen! The next time you’re at your favorite casino, make sure to show your support for your home team – you never know when they might need it!</p>
<h1 id="New-Orleans-Pelicans-lead-NBA-in-casino-revenue"><a href="#New-Orleans-Pelicans-lead-NBA-in-casino-revenue" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Pelicans lead NBA in casino revenue"></a>New Orleans Pelicans lead NBA in casino revenue</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans had a profitable season on the court. They also had a profitable season in the casino realm. The Pelicans led the NBA in casino revenue, bringing in over $4 million.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this high total is that the Pelicans play in one of the casinos cities in America. New Orleans is home to four casinos, including the Harrah’s New Orleans Casino which the Pelicans calls home.</p>
<p>The second most profitable casino team was the Golden State Warriors who brought in just over $2 million in casino revenue. The Warriors are followed by the Washington Wizards, Philadelphia 76ers, and Cleveland Cavaliers who round out the top five casino earners in the NBA.</p>
<p>It’s not just teams that play in casino cities that make money from casinos. The Denver Nuggets, who don’t have a casino within their city limits, still made over $1 million in casino revenue during the 2017-2018 season. This puts them sixth on the list of NBA teams with the biggest casino profits.</p>
<p>So how does casino revenue break down per team? The average team earned just over $871,000 from casinos during last season. The top earner, New Orleans, brought in more than four times that amount at just under $4 million. The Golden State Warriors were a close second at just over $2 million. Rounding out the top five are Washington ($1.5M), Philadelphia ($1.3M), and Cleveland ($1M). </p>
<p>As you can see, there is money to be made from casinos for NBA teams, whether they are located in a city with a large number of casinos or not. And with more and more states legalizing gambling, this trend is likely to continue into future seasons</p>
<h1 id="Pelicans-post-record-blackjack-earnings"><a href="#Pelicans-post-record-blackjack-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans post record blackjack earnings"></a>Pelicans post record blackjack earnings</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans set a franchise record for earnings from blackjack in the recently completed 2017-2018 season. According to sources within the organization, the team took in over $1.7 million from casino games last year.</p>
<p>This impressive haul was fueled by the stellar play of superstar Anthony Davis and breakout performer Nikola Mirotic. The two players were responsible for much of the team’s offensive production and helped lead New Orleans to a sweep of the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Coach Alvin Gentry was quick to credit his team’s success at the blackjack tables to their hard work and dedication on the court. “Our guys put in a lot of hours in practice and it’s great to see them get some rewards for all their effort,” said Gentry.</p>
<p>While most of the money was earned during road trips, the players also took advantage of local casinos when playing at home. “We definitely tried to rack up as many wins as we could when we were in town,” said Davis.</p>
<p>In addition to their playoff run, the Pelicans also managed to win their first division title in club history. This marks another milestone for a team that is quickly establishing itself as one of the top organizations in the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="Thrilling-casino-action-helps-propel-New-Orleans-Pelicans-to-new-heights"><a href="#Thrilling-casino-action-helps-propel-New-Orleans-Pelicans-to-new-heights" class="headerlink" title="Thrilling casino action helps propel New Orleans Pelicans to new heights"></a>Thrilling casino action helps propel New Orleans Pelicans to new heights</h1><p>Led by the stellar play of superstar forward Anthony Davis and the inspired coaching of Alvin Gentry, the New Orleans Pelicans have stormed back into playoff contention in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>
<p>The acquisition of veteran point guard Rajon Rondo has been a key factor in their resurgence, as the fiery floor general has brought toughness and leadership to a young squad that was often prone to turnovers and defensive lapses.</p>
<p>Riding a five-game winning streak, the Pelicans have shot up to sixth place in the West, just one game behind the fourth-place Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>Their recent surge has not gone unnoticed, as evidenced by their rising power rankings across the sports media landscape.</p>
<p>The talented Davis is clearly the driving force behind this team’s success, but it is Gentry’s clever coaching that has helped him reach his full potential.</p>
<p>In previous seasons, Davis was often forced to carry an oversized load on offense, as the Pelicans lacked a quality second scorer. This season, however, Rondo has emerged as a viable scoring threat alongside Davis, which has taken some pressure off of the 23-year-old superstar.</p>
<p>Rondo’s ability to create for others has also been crucial in facilitating Davis’ impressive stat sheet; the two-time All-Star is averaging 27 points, 12 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game this season.</p>
<p>With the playoffs rapidly approaching, it will be interesting to see if Gentry and company can continue their improbable run and secure a berth in basketball’s biggest tournament.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-success-propels-New-Orleans-Pelicans-into-playoff-contention"><a href="#Blackjack-success-propels-New-Orleans-Pelicans-into-playoff-contention" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack success propels New Orleans Pelicans into playoff contention"></a>Blackjack success propels New Orleans Pelicans into playoff contention</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans have been on a tear lately, thanks in no small part to the blistering play of Anthony Davis. But as the saying goes, there’s no “I” in team, and the rest of the Pelicans have been stepping up to fill the scoring gaps.</p>
<p>One such player has been 26-year-old Tyreke Evans, who is having a resurgent season after dealing with injuries in recent years. Evans is currently averaging 19 points and 5 assists per game, both career highs.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t just been Evans providing offense for the Pelicans; players like Dante Cunningham, Jrue Holiday, and Omer Asik have all stepped up when needed.</p>
<p>This newfound depth has allowed the Pelicans to survive Davis’ periodic absences; indeed, they’ve gone 5-2 in games Davis has missed this year.</p>
<p>With an 8-6 record overall, the Pelicans are currently in a three-way tie for sixth place in the Western Conference standings. If they can continue to play well - and stay healthy - they could very well make the playoffs for the first time since 2015.</p>
