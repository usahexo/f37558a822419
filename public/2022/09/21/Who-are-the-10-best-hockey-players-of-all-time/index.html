<h1 id="What-makes-them-the-best-players-ever"><a href="#What-makes-them-the-best-players-ever" class="headerlink" title="What makes them the best players ever?"></a>What makes them the best players ever?</h1><p>There have been many great players throughout the history of basketball. But which ones are the best? Some may say that it is Michael Jordan or LeBron James, while others may say that it is Kobe Bryant or Magic Johnson. So, what makes them the best players ever?</p>
<p>One of the biggest factors is their stats. All of these players have some of the best stats in NBA history. For example, Michael Jordan has the most points in playoff games, Kobe Bryant has the third most points in NBA history, and LeBron James has the most triple doubles in postseason play. They are all also among the top ten players in terms of scoring average and assists.</p>
<p>Another factor is their achievements. These players have won numerous awards and championships. Michael Jordan has six championship rings, Kobe Bryant has five, and LeBron James has four. They have also won MVP awards, finals MVP awards, and many other individual awards.</p>
<p>Their ability to influence the game is also a key factor. They have all changed the way the game is played. For example, Michael Jordan popularized the “Air Jordan” sneakers and playing “above the rim”. Kobe Bryant was one of the first players to use a fadeaway shot and now nearly every player uses that move. And LeBron James has brought a new level of physicality to basketball.</p>
<p>Overall, these players are some of the best ever because of their impressive stats, achievements, and influence on the game.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-they-achieve-such-success"><a href="#How-did-they-achieve-such-success" class="headerlink" title="How did they achieve such success?"></a>How did they achieve such success?</h1><p>The Yankees are one of the most successful teams in professional baseball, with 27 World Series championships. But how did they achieve such success?</p>
<p>One reason is that the team has always been able to attract the best players. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle are some of the biggest stars in baseball history, and all played for the Yankees at some point.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the team has always had a strong management system. The Yankees have had a number of great managers over the years, including Casey Stengel, Joe Torre and current manager Aaron Boone.</p>
<p>Finally, the team has also been very successful in marketing itself. The Yankees have been one of the most popular franchises in all of sports, and their fans are some of the most passionate in the world.</p>
<h1 id="What-did-they-contribute-to-the-sport-of-hockey"><a href="#What-did-they-contribute-to-the-sport-of-hockey" class="headerlink" title="What did they contribute to the sport of hockey?"></a>What did they contribute to the sport of hockey?</h1><p>The Montreal Canadiens are a professional ice hockey team based in Montreal, Quebec. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise is officially bilingual, as it broadcasts its games in both French and English. The Canadiens are one of the Original Six teams, along with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, and New York Rangers.</p>
<p>Founded in 1909, the Canadiens are the longest continuously operating professional ice hockey team worldwide. The team’s championship season in 1992-93 was the last time a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup. The Canadiens have won 24 Stanley Cups, more than any other NHL team. They have played in 25 Stanley Cup Finals, more than any other club.</p>
<p>The Canadiens organization was founded on December 4th 1909 by J. Ambrose O’Brien as a charter member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club advanced to the 1912 Stanley Cup Finals against the Ottawa Senators but lost in a two-game series. The Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup championship in 1916-17 against the Portland Rosebuds of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA).</p>
<p>The following season, 1917-18, saw unprecedented player mobility when several players from Quebec’s French-speaking clubs jumped to the anglophone Montreal Wanderers. This led to establishment of prohibition on player transfers mid-season which lasted for 50 years. One such player, Joe Malone, set an NHL record that still stands for most goals scored in a single game with seven against Ottawa on February 2nd 1918 despite playing only 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The Canadiens continued to dominate hockey through the 1920s winning six Stanley Cups including an appearance in 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where they were swept by Calgary Tigers of Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). In 1930s Depression era, cup victories became more sporadic with only one win recorded over this period but with players like Maurice Richard and Jean Béliveau lighting up arenas across North America captivating fans new and old. The 1940s started slowly for Montreal but picked up steam by decade’s end culminating with another championship win against Detroit Red Wings in 1950.</p>
<p>In 1951-52 season Richard became first NHL player to score 500 goals in his career and helped lead Canadiens to sixth consecutive championship - a record that still stands today. Unfortunately tragedy would soon touch Richard as he was suspended for attacking a linesman during game - an incident that lead to rioting among fans known as Richard Riot. Despite this setback Richard would continue to be one of most prolific goal scorers in league history retiring with 544 goals scored - still third highest all time behind Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe .</p>
<p>The 1970s were unkind to Montreal as they failed to make it out of first round of playoffs even once however things turned around dramatically in late 1970s culminating with back-to-back championships against Boston Bruins at start of 1980s. Unfortunately another riot occurred as Habs fans burned cars and looted stores after being eliminated from playoffs prematurely again in 1986. This dark period eventually gave way to resurgence led by goalie Patrick Roy who backstopped Montreal teams to cup victories in 1993 and 1996 before controversially being traded away late in his career .</p>
<p>Today Montreal Canadiens continue to be one of most popular teams not just in Canada but also throughout United States having one of largest fan bases among all professional sports teams . While they may not have been quite as successful over past decade or so they remain one of most storied franchises in all sport with rich history that continues to fascinate many fans around world .</p>
<h1 id="What-is-their-legacy"><a href="#What-is-their-legacy" class="headerlink" title="What is their legacy?"></a>What is their legacy?</h1><p>The legacy of the Beatles is one that is still felt today. Although they disbanded over 50 years ago, their music and influence can still be heard around the world.</p>
<p>The Beatles were formed in Liverpool, England in 1960. The band was made up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They first got popular in Liverpool with their skiffle music, but it was when they switched to rock and roll that they really took off.</p>
<p>In 1962, the Beatles released their first album, Please Please Me. It was an instant success and the band soon became international celebrities. They continued to produce hit after hit, including songs like “Let It Be” and “Hey Jude.”</p>
<p>In 1969, the Beatles disbanded. This was a huge shock to their fans and left many wondering what would happen to them next. However, each Beatle went on to have successful solo careers.</p>
<p>The Beatles have been credited with changing the landscape of popular music. They were one of the first bands to experiment with new sounds and styles, paving the way for future artists. Their music has also been influential in other areas such as fashion and art.</p>
<p>The legacy of the Beatles is one that will never be forgotten. Their music has touched millions of people around the world and they continue to be one of the most popular bands ever.</p>
